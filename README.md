Loan prediction dataset was taken from www.kaggle.com
The project is to build a model to predict whether the customer will default loan replayment based on his payment history.
The project was done in R.
Implemented Ensemble method using caret package to build the optimal solution to predict the class of the Label variable. 
Built Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, CART 5.0, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, SVM and KNN to predict the Label variable.
Random forest gave maximum accuracy of 83%
